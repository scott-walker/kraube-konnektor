/**
 * Abstract execution interface — the core abstraction of claude-connector.
 *
 * All interaction with Claude Code goes through an executor. This decouples
 * the public API ({@link Claude}, {@link Session}) from the underlying
 * transport mechanism.
 *
 * ## Why this abstraction exists
 *
 * Today the only executor is {@link CliExecutor} (spawns `claude -p`).
 * Tomorrow Anthropic may ship a native Node.js SDK, an HTTP API,
 * or a Unix socket interface. By coding against `IExecutor`, the entire
 * public surface remains stable — only a new executor implementation is needed.
 *
 * ## Contract
 *
 * - `execute()` runs a query to completion and returns a structured result.
 * - `stream()` runs a query and yields incremental events as an async iterator.
 * - Both methods receive a fully resolved argument list (no option merging here).
 * - Executors must NOT hold mutable state between calls (stateless per invocation).
 * - Error conditions must throw {@link ClaudeConnectorError} subclasses.
